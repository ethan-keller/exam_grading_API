Normally we would have a routing server etc and then routing and authorization could be partially in there                                                                                                          	|

I did a lot of refactoring and resolved checkstyle issues. Transition to the hexagonal architecture is now complete. I adapted the User Service methods work with the new way of password storage, which is through communicating with the Authentication service. 	|

## Main problems encountered:

- Figuring out where token validation should happen.			
- Efficiently splitting code so that it makes sense and the code doesn't become too unreadable
- Checkstyle issues had to be resolved and it took more time then expected.
- Figuring out how to use the rest API for inter-service communication.
