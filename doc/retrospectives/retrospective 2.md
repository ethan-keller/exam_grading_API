| 1 )Students can only pass a course if they at least get a 5.75 as their final grade. 2)Teachers shall be able to see a list of students with a passing grade for any course. 3)Teachers should be able to view the mean grade for any course. 4)Students should be able to view courses they passed 5) Students could see a cumulative mean of all their grades 6)Students can see passing rates for a course 7)Teachers can see mean and variance for a course 	| Create studentGradeController methods                                                      	| Arjun            	|                4 	|              3 	| Y    	| Testing was done, but due to new changes in the controller methods, the tests need to be reworked.

I refactored the code, added extensive documentation and implemented tests to achive 97% line coverage. I spent a lot of time to try and figure out the best strategy to test the UserController class. I had troubles mocking the UserRepository interface so I had to go through a lot of documentation. Overall, I'm happy that the User micro-service is finished now. Next week I'll be working on Grading micro-service to finish the functionalities. 	|

## Main problems encountered: 
- Underestimation of testing (time wise and quality wise).
- Working with composite key repositories.
- Figuring out the correct strategy for testing.		
- Using mockito to mock dependencies and solving the problems encountered along the way.

## Adjustments for the next Sprint:
- Stop underestimating the amount of effort testing takes.
- Taking the time to test to make sure it adds value and preferably bugs.
