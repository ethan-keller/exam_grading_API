| As a user I must be either a student or a teacher so that I can interact with the application based on my role.                    	| Create the User entity                    	| Noyan, Arjun     	|                7 	|              3 	| Yes  	| Setting up the database took a lot of time because of the problems I ran into with the installation process of MySQL. At first we were thinking of storing the grades, courses etc. inside Student entity but then we got together and decided on the schema, so now those information will be stored in other microservices so the workload became less than our expectation. 	|

## Main problems encountered:	
- We made documents like database ER-models, doc for all API endpoints etc. a bit late which stalls the development				
- We lost a bit of time while being unsure about Spring & Microservices				
- The structure of the application was not quite clear until we came up with the databse schemas				
- Figuring out how to connect a database to the application and setting up the database itself took quite some time				
- The coordination of who should do what didn't go very smoothly			
- In the first week, we couldn't start coding since we hadn't had the microservice lecture yet. 	
					
## Adjustments for the next Sprint:
- Prepare needed structural documents (graphs, doc of all API endpoints, ...) before implementing --> saves a lot of time				
- Clear research if knowledge has to be sharpened				
- Generalisation of the API.	
- The API document that we created needs to be complete in order for us to establish the connecction between micro-services correctly			
- More and clearer communication.
- The sprint iterations will be from wednesday to wednesday from now on.
